## Overview
Solution to design Result summary component on Frontend Mentor using only HTML and CSS

## My process
- First designed the site layout with HTML
- Took note of font size variation, used 3 <h> element in this design
- Each element are contained in a <div> for easy styling
- proceed to include  css styles in the design while using random color and fonts
- Started with card design and including box-shadow
- Worked on the result section before moving to summary
- worked on summary design and color while including svg and button
- Added colors and fonts as specified in the style guide and also adding active state for button
- include media queries to make the page mobile responsive.
- Check through to see any missing components or error.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Hanken Grotesk](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hanken+Grotesk) - Font family


### What I learned

I learnt the need of not having to use relative unit most  of the time because when deveoping the inner circle, using a relative unit will cause the circle to shrink as the screen size width decreases. using an absolute unit fixes this problem. hence I only applied relative unit to text while shapes uses absolute unit.


### Continued development

I will probably focus on learning to properly use relative and absolute units, leaing when best to use which and also using hsl color selector.
